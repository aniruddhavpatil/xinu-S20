Assignment 2 Report

- Does your program output any garbage? If yes, why?
Yes. The xsh shell prompt is displayed while the producer and consumer are printing their outputs. I think it is because of the print statement not being an atomic operatiion. Since it is not atomic, the print statements from the producer and consumer get interrupted before completion.

- Are all the produced values getting consumed? Check your program for a small count like 20.
No. Not all produced values are getting consumed.

- Write down all the functions in the project.

1) shellcmd xsh_prodcons(int nargs, char *args[])
Creates the process producer and consumer and put them in ready queue.

2) int isValidNumber(char *number)
Helper function to validate whether the given argument is a number less than or equal to INT_MAX represented as a character string.

3) void producer(int count)
Iterates from 0 to count, setting the value of the global variable 'n' each time.

4) void consumer(int count)
Reads the value of the global variable 'n' 'count' times and prints it.
